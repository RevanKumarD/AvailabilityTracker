# AvailabilityTracker
  An initiative project to build an application to bridge the gap between the people who are providing facilities and people who are in need of it during these tough Covid times in India. Basically, if you are in need of any facilities, say bed, oxygen, vaccine etc get to know the possible near availabilities. This application is visioned to be used by both public and government so anyone capable of providing facilities can be utilised and also gives us the ground reality of the pandemic situation.  One primary issue to be solved will be to regulate huge traffic and also to keep the spammers away.
